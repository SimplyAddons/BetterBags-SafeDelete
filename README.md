# BetterBags: Safe Delete
An extension for the [BetterBags](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/better-bags) WoW addon, to categorize all items that are safe to delete from your inventory, into a single category named "Delete". This typically includes lore-related books, letters and other trash items.

The goal of this plugin is to categorize items that have no particular in-game use, allowing you to quickly identify and delete/vendor them. This saves you both bag/bank space, and the time spent searching on WoWHead. Items that are used towards mount, achievement or transmog collecting will not be included.

Supports multiple game locales, including English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.

I will be expanding the internal item database over time, as I continue to quest and complete content throughout The War Within. Please feel free to leave a comment here, or on GitHub, with the name's of any items you encounter and I'll be sure to include it.
